				This test verifies that only valid IBM campaigns can be associated with an
				Opportunity. Currently this scripts expects to have two campaigns as valid
				campaignnameabc and campaignnameghi. That is these valid campaigns have end dates 
				that are not over a year old. In addition there is one invalid campaign set up (campaignnamedef)
				which has an end date over a year old.
				
				This data will need to be seeded when the Web Service for campaigns is
				available as there is no direct user entry enabled for campaign codes.
